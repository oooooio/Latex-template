% INTRODUCTION PARAGRAPH
% Replace the text below with your manuscript submission introduction
We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled "[YOUR MANUSCRIPT TITLE]" for consideration for publication in [JOURNAL NAME].

% BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION PARAGRAPH
% Describe the research problem and its importance in your field
[DESCRIBE THE RESEARCH PROBLEM AND ITS IMPORTANCE. For example: Ocean wave height forecasting is critical for maritime safety, offshore operations, and renewable marine energy management. While traditional physics-based numerical models and conventional deep learning approaches have made significant contributions to this field, they often suffer from high computational costs, limited generalization capabilities, and requirements for extensive domain-specific datasets.]

% STUDY APPROACH PARAGRAPH
% Explain your approach and its novelty
[DESCRIBE YOUR APPROACH AND ITS NOVELTY. For example: This study addresses these challenges by introducing Chronos, a tokenized large-scale time series foundation model, to significant wave height (SWH) prediction. Our work represents the first comprehensive evaluation of large language model (LLM)-inspired architectures in oceanographic forecasting applications.]

\textbf{The main contributions of our study are as follows:}
\begin{itemize}
    % Replace each item below with your specific contributions
    \item \textbf{[CONTRIBUTION 1 TITLE]} [Describe your first main contribution in detail]
    
    \item \textbf{[CONTRIBUTION 2 TITLE]} [Describe your second main contribution in detail]
    
    \item \textbf{[CONTRIBUTION 3 TITLE]} [Describe your third main contribution in detail]
    
    \item \textbf{[CONTRIBUTION 4 TITLE]} [Describe your fourth main contribution in detail]
    
    % Add more items as needed
    % \item \textbf{[ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTION]} [Description]
\end{itemize}

% METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS PARAGRAPH
% Summarize your methodology and key findings
[DESCRIBE YOUR METHODOLOGY AND KEY RESULTS. For example: The methodology employs data from five NOAA buoy stations spanning diverse marine environments (water depths: 16-5023m, record spans: 14-32 years). Our results demonstrate that attention-based tokenization and ordinal output modeling enable robust temporal reasoning, particularly excelling in mid-to-long-term forecasts where traditional approaches typically struggle.]

% SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT PARAGRAPH
% Explain the broader impact and significance of your work
[EXPLAIN THE BROADER IMPACT OF YOUR WORK. For example: This work opens new avenues for applying foundation models to geophysical forecasting and demonstrates the potential of LLM-inspired architectures in environmental modeling. The findings have immediate practical implications for maritime operations, coastal management, and offshore renewable energy systems.]

% CONTRIBUTION TO FIELD PARAGRAPH
% Describe how your work contributes to the scientific community
[DESCRIBE YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. For example: We believe this research makes a significant contribution to both the oceanographic modeling and machine learning communities, offering both theoretical insights into transformer-based time series modeling and practical solutions for operational wave forecasting systems.]

% OPTIONAL: PREPRINT AND DATA AVAILABILITY
% Uncomment and modify if applicable
% A preprint version of this manuscript is available on \href{[PREPRINT_URL]}{[PREPRINT_PLATFORM]}. All data and code will be made publicly available upon publication to ensure reproducibility.
